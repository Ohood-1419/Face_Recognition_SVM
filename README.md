# Face_Recognition_SVM
Recording the Attendance of Students Base-on Face Recognition with mask and without Using Support Vector Machine



- We used these classification algorithms to train the model to recognize the studentsâ€™ faces on a dataset we collected and annotated manually. Then we will show the differences of using SVM classifier and SVM with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
